					THE Dresden clock on the mantel struck twelve in soft, slow, golden notes. As the gentle echoes died away, Horace
					Abernethey, sitting huddled in a morris chair before the fire of logs, stirred feebly. Presently, he sat erect,
					moving clumsily, with the laboriousness of senility. But there was nothing of the aged in the glances of his keen,
					dark eyes, which shone forth brightly from out the pallid parchment of his face. His intent gaze darted first
					toward the clock, to verify the hour of which the gong had given warning; it went next to the closed window on the
					right of the fireplace, over which the shades had not been drawn. The unsheltered panes were spangled with
					raindrops, and, as he watched, a new gust beat its tattoo on the glass. The old man drew down the tip of his thin,
					beaklike nose in a[2] curious movement of disgust, then stroked petulantly the white cascade of beard that flowed
					to his bosom.
					“Curse such weather!” He snarled, in a voice querulous and shrill with years. He stood up with sudden alertness,
					surprising after his first awkward slowness; a brisk gesture of the head threw back from his face the luxuriant
					white curls of hair. “But, in spite of it, I must go again, and so make an end of the job—else—death might take me
					unawares.”
					Abernethey glanced aimlessly about the long, low-ceiled room, now lighted only by the glow from the fire. After a
					little, he advanced to the center, where a concert-grand piano dominated the scene. In a moment more, he had
					lighted the tall lamp that stood at hand. A sheet of music in manuscript was lying on the rack. He seized this,
					and scanned it eagerly, muttering the while.
					“Curious it should work out so,” he exclaimed, at last; “curious, and infernally clever, too!” He seated himself
					before the instrument, still holding communion with his thoughts. “Yes, it will do—capitally—and it[3] has the
					spirit of the thing. It chants the curse.”

					啊,海燕啊
					在苍茫的大海上，狂风卷集着乌云。在乌云和大海之间，海燕像黑色的闪电，在高傲地飞翔。

					一会儿翅膀碰着波浪，一会儿箭一般地直冲向乌云，它叫喊着，──就在这鸟儿勇敢的叫喊声里，乌云听出了欢乐。

					在这叫喊声里──充满着对暴风雨的渴望！在这叫喊声里，乌云听出了愤怒的力量、热情的火焰和胜利的信心。

					海鸥在暴风雨来临之前呻吟着，──呻吟着，它们在大海上飞窜，想把自己对暴风雨的恐惧，掩藏到大海深处。

					海鸭也在呻吟着，──它们这些海鸭啊，享受不了生活的战斗的欢乐：轰隆隆的雷声就把它们吓坏了。

					蠢笨的企鹅，胆怯地把肥胖的身体躲藏到悬崖底下……只有那高傲的海燕，勇敢地，自由自在地，在泛起白沫的大海上飞翔！
